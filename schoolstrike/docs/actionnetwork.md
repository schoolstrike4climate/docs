## What is Action Network?
Action network is where SS4C stores all the information of people who have signed up to SS4C - at an event, texted in, organised  a previous strike etc.
It allows us to:
- Send emails
- Search for contacts phone numbers, emails addresses,
- Create lists of phone numbers + email addresses of people who attended previous strikes
